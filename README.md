# Filtering ECG From Powe Line Noise
 A MATLAB script that emoves power line noise from ECG signals. It loads original and noisy ECG data, computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for both, and visualizes their spectra. By eliminating specific frequency components from the noisy signal's FFT, the code performs an Inverse FFT to recover and plot the cleaned ECG signal.
